<br/>
The report discusses in detail how the final models were arrived at and also includes the summary of Exploratory Data Analysis, ML related tasks and Neural Networks trained as a part of this project. 
<br/>
<br/> The code is included in the colab notebooks. The ML tasks notebook contains code for ML models used other than Neural Networks. The NN notebook specifically contains the code used for training vaious NNs. 
  > Custom accuracy of *99.67%* was obtained using Random Forest Regressor for score prediction.  > The best accuracy obtained for winner prediction was *61.02%* for the Random Forest Classifier.
